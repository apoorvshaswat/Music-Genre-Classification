# Music-Genre-Classification
This project classifies audio files into 10 genres using CNNs. Leveraging the GTZAN dataset, it processes audio into Mel spectrograms for input. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, trained on a split dataset, and evaluates performance through accuracy metrics. It includes a prediction function for classifying new audio files.
